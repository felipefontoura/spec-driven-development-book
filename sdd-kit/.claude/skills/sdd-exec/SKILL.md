description: 'Explicit command-style skill for implementing approved SDD tasks from tasks.md with tight scope, tests, and verification evidence. Use only when the user explicitly asks to execute or implement a specific approved SDD task or feature. Do not auto-load for discussion, planning, review, or unapproved tasks.'

# SDD Exec

Implement approved tasks while preserving traceability to requirements and design.

## Purpose

Execution turns approved specs into code. The agent must stay within the task scope, follow project conventions, verify the result, and update task status only when evidence exists. Because this edits production code, use it only after an explicit user request to execute or implement approved SDD work.

## Workflow

1. Load the SDD reference.
   - Read `../_shared/references/sdd-practical.md`.
   - Apply the Language Policy: respond and write artifacts in the user's initial chat language while keeping skill instructions and templates in EN-US.
   - Load relevant `.ai/steering/*.md` files when present, especially `tech-stack.md`, `conventions.md`, and `principles.md`.

2. Locate the feature and task, then validate the gate.
   - Use `.ai/sdd/specs/NNN-feature-name/`.
   - Read `.status`.
   - Validate `.status` against the official status values from `sdd-practical.md`.
   - If `.status` is missing or invalid, stop and ask the user to repair it; do not infer task approval from `tasks.md` existing.
   - Block if status is not `tasks:approved` or `implementation:in-progress`, unless the user explicitly requests a spike.
   - If blocked, report the current status and recommend `/sdd-tasks` approval as the next safe action.
   - Read `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, and `decisions.md` if present.
   - Identify the requested task. If no task is specified, select the first incomplete task whose dependencies are complete and confirm with the user.

3. Reconcile workspace state.
   - Inspect current files before editing.
   - Do not overwrite user changes.
   - If unexpected edits overlap with the task, stop and ask how to proceed.

4. Build an execution checklist.
   - Extract task work items, acceptance criteria, file targets, and verification items.
   - Print the checklist before editing.
   - Set `.status` to `implementation:in-progress` when starting implementation from `tasks:approved`.
   - If already `implementation:in-progress`, preserve that status while continuing incomplete approved tasks.

5. Implement.
   - Keep scope limited to the selected task.
   - Follow existing project patterns and real dependency APIs.
   - Add or update tests when behavior changes or regressions are possible.
   - Stop if requirements and design conflict; do not guess.
   - Record any necessary spec change as a proposed update, not an implicit code divergence.

6. Verify.
   - Run task-specific verification first when listed.
   - Run the broad project verification command when available: lint, test, build, or the project-defined gate.
   - If no automated verification exists, perform manual checks and state the limitation.
   - Do not claim completion without fresh verification evidence.

7. Update tracking.
   - Mark completed checklist items in `tasks.md` only after evidence exists.
   - Mark the task complete only after implementation and verification pass.
   - If all tasks are complete, set `.status` to `implementation:done`.
   - Otherwise keep `.status` as `implementation:in-progress`.
   - Update `.ai/sdd/INDEX.md` with the current status when practical; if not updated, tell the user the index may be stale.

8. Report.
   - Summarize files changed.
   - Summarize requirements/design coverage.
   - Include verification report with exact command, exit code, summary, and PASS/FAIL verdict.
   - Suggest the next incomplete task or recommend review when all tasks are complete.

## Verification Report Format

```text
VERIFICATION REPORT
Claim: [claim]
Command: [exact command or manual check]
Exit code: [0/non-zero/not applicable]
Output summary: [key result]
Errors: [none or summary]
Verdict: PASS/FAIL
```

## Critical Rules

- Do not implement before `tasks:approved`.
- Do not infer task approval from file existence; require valid `.status`.
- Do not expand scope beyond the selected task.
- Do not mark work complete without verification evidence.
- Do not hide failing checks; report actual status.
- Do not update requirements or design silently during implementation.
