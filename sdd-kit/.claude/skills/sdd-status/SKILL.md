description: 'Explicit command-style skill for inspecting .ai/sdd state and recommending the next safe action. Use only when the user explicitly asks for SDD status, progress, blockers, readiness, or next action. Do not auto-load for general SDD work; do not create specs or implement code.'

# SDD Status

Inspect the SDD workspace and report current progress, blockers, and next actions.

## Purpose

STATUS gives operational visibility across `.ai/sdd/` without changing artifacts. It helps the user understand what exists, what is approved, what is still draft, what is blocked, and what the next safe SDD step should be. Treat it as an explicit utility command, not as a semantic auto-loaded skill for ordinary SDD authoring.

## Workflow

1. Load the SDD reference.
   - Read `../_shared/references/sdd-practical.md`.
   - Apply the Language Policy: respond and write artifacts in the user's initial chat language while keeping skill instructions and templates in EN-US.
   - Use package-level `templates/sdd-index.md` as the dashboard reference when useful.
   - Load relevant `.ai/steering/*.md` files only if they help explain project context; do not summarize steering unless useful.
   - Treat `.ai/strategy/handoff/strategy-brief.md` as optional upstream context and `.ai/sdd/handoff/sdd-brief.md` as optional downstream handoff output.

2. Inspect the workspace.
   - Check whether `.ai/sdd/` exists.
   - Check `.ai/sdd/INDEX.md` if present.
   - Check `.ai/sdd/PLAN.md` if present.
   - Check `.ai/strategy/handoff/strategy-brief.md` if present and report it as an available upstream handoff.
   - Check `.ai/sdd/handoff/sdd-brief.md` if present and report its readiness/status summary.
   - List `.ai/sdd/ideas/*.md` if present.
   - List `.ai/sdd/specs/*/` directories.
   - For each spec directory, read `.status` when present.
   - For each spec directory, note presence of `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `review.md`, and `decisions.md`.
   - Compute the next feature ID from actual spec directories using the shared Feature Workspace Identity algorithm; report it as informational only.
   - Flag duplicate numeric prefixes, non-canonical spec directory names, missing `.status`, and invalid `.status` values.

3. Assess gates.
   - Identify specs that are ready for PRD, SPEC, TASKS, EXEC, or REVIEW.
   - Identify specs blocked by missing artifacts, draft statuses, or missing approvals.
   - Identify implementation specs with incomplete tasks when `tasks.md` exists.
   - Identify specs whose `.status` conflicts with existing artifacts.

4. Produce a concise dashboard.
   - Group by Upstream Handoffs, Plan, Ideas, Specs, Handoff Output, In Progress, Review Ready, and Blocked.
   - Include exact paths for important artifacts.
   - Include the current `.status` value for each spec.
   - Recommend one or more next commands such as `/sdd-prd`, `/sdd-spec`, `/sdd-tasks`, `/sdd-exec`, or `/sdd-review`.

5. Do not modify files.
   - STATUS is read-only.
   - If an index or status appears stale, recommend an update instead of editing it.

## Output Format

```text
SDD STATUS

Workspace: .ai/sdd
Steering: .ai/steering present/missing

Upstream Handoffs:
- .ai/strategy/handoff/strategy-brief.md: present/missing

Plan:
- [missing/draft/approved] .ai/sdd/PLAN.md

Ideas:
- 001-name — idea:captured — .ai/sdd/ideas/001-name.md

Specs:
- 001-feature — requirements:approved
  Artifacts: requirements.md yes, design.md no, tasks.md no, review.md no
  Next: /sdd-spec

Feature Workspace:
- Next feature ID: 002
- Numbering source: filesystem `.ai/sdd/specs/*/`
- Issues: none / [duplicate prefix, invalid status, non-canonical directory]

Handoff Output:
- .ai/sdd/handoff/sdd-brief.md: present/missing/readiness

Blocked / Attention:
- [Path] [problem]

Recommended next action:
- [Specific next step]
```

## Quality Bar

- Be accurate and path-specific.
- Prefer short dashboards over long commentary.
- Do not infer approvals from file existence; use `.status` and artifact headers when available.
- Flag missing or inconsistent status instead of silently normalizing it.
- Compute numbering from actual directories, never from memory or `INDEX.md`.
- When a strategy handoff exists but no SDD artifacts exist, recommend `/sdd-plan` or `/sdd-prd` depending on scope.
- When tasks are approved but `sdd-brief.md` is missing or stale, recommend refreshing the SDD handoff.

## Critical Rules

- Do not create, edit, or delete files in this skill.
- Do not approve drafts.
- Do not implement code.
- Do not run expensive verification commands unless the user explicitly asks for a health check.
